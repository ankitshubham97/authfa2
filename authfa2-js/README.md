# AuthFA2 Protocol and SDK
I have documented the protocol in the form of a [whitepaper][NFT-Auth WP].

I have developed [an SDK in NodeJS][AuthFA2 NodeJS SDK]. This could be used by any application intending to implement AuthFA2. There is a sample web-app which demonstrates how; the entire code can be found here: [frontend][Frontend Code] [backend][Auth Server Code]

This code is live and up at https://authfa2-frontend.vercel.app/
